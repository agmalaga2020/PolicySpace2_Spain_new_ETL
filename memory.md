# Cline Agent Memory Log

## 2025-05-10

- Started new session.
- Reviewed `TASK TODO.md` and `adapter_spain_info/adapter_spain_info.md`.
- Confirmed with user that `adapter_spain_info/` contains documentation of previous work.
- Created this `memory.md` file to log ongoing actions.
- Beginning investigation of `input/estimativas_pop.csv` as per plan.

- Investigated `KeyError: 3` occurring during `tests.py` execution.
- **Error Source:** The error originated in `world/demographics.py` within the `check_demographics` function. It was caused by attempting to access mortality/fertility data for an agent's specific age (e.g., 3) when the underlying CSV data (e.g., `mortality_men_01.csv`) only contains data for specific age groups (0, 1, 5, 10, ...), not every individual year.
- **Solution Implemented:**
    - Modified `world/demographics.py` in the `check_demographics` function.
    - Implemented a fallback mechanism:
        - If an agent's exact age is not found in the `mortality_men`, `mortality_women`, or `fertility` grouped DataFrames:
            1. It searches for the closest available age group that is less than or equal to the agent's current age.
            2. If no such group exists (i.e., the agent's age is less than the smallest age group in the data), it defaults to using the data from the smallest available age group.
- Updated `adapter_spain_info/simulation_test.md` with details of the error, traceback, and the implemented solution.
- Updated this `memory.md` file.
